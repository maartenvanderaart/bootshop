Software engineering daily has a few episodes that (at least in part) cover Functions as a Service (AWS Lambda-like services), the concept of serverless architecture and the Serverless framework (previously known as JAWS). Find it here: http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/tag/serverless/

http://justserverless.com/blog/ is a blog by Philip MÃ¼ns, mostly about the Serverless framework for which he recently joined the core development team. Simple tutorials to familiarize yourself with the framework.

On Martin Fowlers blog, Mike Roberts wrote an article on the concepts of serverless architecture: http://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html
He is also featured in one of the episodes of Software Engineering Daily on the subject.

Thoughtworks describes the concept on their Tech Radar: https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/serverless-architecture
